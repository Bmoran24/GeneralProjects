This project represents the culmination of a semesters worth of learning HTML/JS. It was a solo project so all of the code is mine--however the assets used
for the characters/sprites as well as the sounds were taken from online libraries that allow public use. All of the citations for these are located in the
doc.html file.

The general concept for the game is to avoid an endless horde of monsters while collecting ammo (slime) that can be used to fight back. The controls are 
WASD to move the character and the Mouse Pointer can be used to aim at the enemies with the left-click allowing the player to fire.
