    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>I began this project by modeling it after Circle Blast, which is evident in the way in which the core game loop and setup code
        is formatted. However, I made significant changes to differentiate it from Circle Blast, mainly dealing with the movement being
        Keyboard Input and Mouse Input. WASD controls the character and the mouse is instead used as the crosshair that allows the player
        to make strategic decisions about when to move away from the enemy and when to focus more on using the mouse to aim a shot. I then
        implemented a variety of additional features, such as the seek behaviour of the enemies that, although not perfect, is largely
        effective.

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Functional - I used PIXI JS and JavaScript to create my experience that differs in many ways
            from the in-class exercises that it is inspired by. It is also a straightforward and easy to
            use application that throws no errors/exceptions
        </li>

        <li>Design & Interaction - I think the U.I and graphic design are visually appealing and simplistic. Outside of directions 
            regarding the basic user controls, the user can navigate easily
        </li>

        <li>Media - The sprites and sounds used match the theme of the game, enhancing the user experience. PNGs are only used</li>
    </ul>
