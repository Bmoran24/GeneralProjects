This project was one that I worked on in a team of 4. While we split up the workload, I mainly contributed to a lot of the core game mechanics and
systems such as the infinite game loop, turn-based system, and move-selction. Other team members worked on the art and animation aspects, so I'll mostly
be speaking to the contributions that I myself made through the code that doesn't relate to those portions of production.

My team and I used Discord to organize the distribution of tasks and ensure that we finished everything by the deadline. We were given about a 2 month deadline
for the project, but much of the work was expected to be completed outside of class time, so realistically (due to the fact we all had other classwork we
also had to focus on) the final build is a culmination of our work under an even tighter timeframe. 

Much of my work was done in the Game1, Enemy, and Character classes, as these are the main classes used to make the gameplay work fundamentally. I set
up the systems that allow the player and enemy to attack each other and take respective damages, and I also set up much of the UI (not the artwork, more
the organization). I also created the system that keeps the game running indefinitely until the player's health drops below 0. 

Due to the time constraints of the project and the small team size, there are clear flaws in the game, such as move balancing issues and no clear way to 
"win", since the game just continues until the player is killed. However, many of the core systems presented in the game are a good representation of 
a rough mockup of the game that could be improved upon in the future with more polish and time.
