This was a class project that required us to create a simple Shmup with input management, collision detection, and some kind of progression system. Further
details of how these ideas were implemented are provided below:

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: Topdown
-   Camera Movement: Does not Move
-   Player Health: 3 Lives
-   End Condition: Infinite unless player loses all lives -- will result in Game Over
-   Scoring: Score increases over time

### Game Description

Outer Space Shmup where players take control of a space ship that must survive an onslaught of enemy ships and hostile extraterrestrials

### Controls

-   Movement
    -   Left: A
    -   Right: D
-   Fire: SPACE

## Further Additions

_List out what you added to your game to make it different for you_
- Screen-Wrapping on the left and right sides of the screen
- Power-up that boosts speed (activated after player gets hit)
