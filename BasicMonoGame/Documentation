This was an individual assignment for class that required us to create a simple MonoGame with user-input and a level system of some object collecting items. 
I chose a simple MarioKart model that went around collecting coins, creating the simple level system that was requested. Also, we were required to add some
other game element that made our game more unique, which is why I chose to have the Bowser model constantly chasing after the player, adding a little bit more
of a challenge. 

With every level completed, more coins are added for the user to collect, making each one slightly more difficult. This was a fairly small project overall
that did not take much time to complete, which is why there are some clear improvements that could be made to add more polish. However, it is a fairly
good representation of basic C# and MonoGame skills that have only been expanded upon since.
