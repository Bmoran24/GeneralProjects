My additional feature is an enemy that constantly follows Mario. This player is represemted as a Bowser
texture, and if the enemy and player collide, it is an instant Game Over. I created the enemy as a 
"player" but then added a helper method in Main in order to differentiate the enemy movement in
comparison to the player.

Depending on the coordinate positions of the player, the enemy will always move 2 pixels in each direction
towards the player with every frame. This provides an additional challenge to the player as they have to 
avoid colliding with the enemy while also racing against the clock.
